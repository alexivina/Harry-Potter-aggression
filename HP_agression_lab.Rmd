```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages and read in data

```{r, include = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
hp_data <- read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")

```

I'm in lab week 6!

2. Basic wrangling and make a graph of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy aggression rates

```{r}

hp_graph <- hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" |Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() + # To switch y and x axis
  theme_classic()


# Compare within the group with possition = "dodge" which makes it cluster instead of graph
# stacked column graph as a default with a weird line in the middle

hp_graph
```
